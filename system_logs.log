Hi Jason
Please find attached the Single Source Justification for the subscription to the Integrated
Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) that will be used for the environmental risk mapping of our
OE’s and which we can also use to screen new acquisitions/greenfield developments. There is no
other tool available on the market to do this and it’s used by other large multi-nationals.
Please can you sign this so that we can provide it to procurement to progress the PO and
addition of IBAT to our suppliers system? Please let us know if any questions.
Thanks
Kind regards
Rachael
